        "31000000": "{\"3.1\": [\"Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the loss of both hearing and vision. This syndrome accounts for more than half of all hereditary cases of deaf\\u2013blindness in the United States (1\\u20134). USH can be subdivided into three clinical classifications (USH1, USH2, USH3) based on the onset, severity, and progression of hearing loss and vestibular abnormalities. USH is further subtyped depending on the affected gene. For all clinical classifications, hearing loss is the primary identifying symptom. Vision loss presents as retinitis pigmentosa, beginning with the loss of night vision followed by a gradual narrowing of the visual field and blindness.\", \"Although all mouse models of USH display early-onset hearing loss, most fail to present with degenerative retinal phenotypes. This represents a major challenge, hampering the investigation of mechanisms leading to vision loss (5\\u20137). Potential reasons for the absence of retinal degeneration in murine models include marked interspecies differences in photoreceptor ultrastructure, rod/cone ratio, density and distribution, and a potentially distinct subcellular distribution of some of the USH proteins (8). Specifically, the mouse retina is rod dominant and the photoreceptors lack well-defined calyceal processes, which have previously been described as being abnormal or absent (8,9). The calyceal processes are long microvilli-like actin rich structures resembling hair cell stereocilia, that emerge from the apical region of the inner segment (IS) and envelop the base of the outer segment (OS) in rods and cones. This collar-like structure of the calyceal processes is present in zebrafish, frogs, pigs and primates, including humans, but is absent or vestigial in mouse photoreceptors (8,10,11). Within the human and non-human primate retina, USH1 proteins were reported to localize to the calyceal processes and the inner\\u2013outer segment interface (8,12). The USH1 protein Harmonin was also localized at the tips of the M\\u00fcller glia apical microvilli and the adherens junctions between M\\u00fcller glia and photoreceptor cells forming the outer limiting membrane in the human retina (13). Harmonin localization is consistent with a previous study performed in zebrafish retina (14). While localization of USH proteins is an important first step in understanding their functions, genetic mutation studies in models capable of replicating the photoreceptor degeneration are critical to understand the underlying mechanisms of USH pathology. Notably, zebrafish loss-of-function models of USH1 and USH2 genes orthologs have been instrumental in characterizing their roles in photoreceptor structure and maintenance (14\\u201318). In contrast, virtually nothing is known about the mechanisms of retinal degeneration associated with USH3.\", \"Mutations in CLRN1 gene (clarin1, USH3A) encoding a four-transmembrane domain protein (CLRN1), are the leading cause of USH3, resulting in progressive loss of hearing and retinitis pigmentosa in humans, with variable vestibular dysfunction (19\\u201322). As with other USH-associated proteins, understanding the role of CLRN1 in the retina has been hindered by the lack of a retinal degenerative phenotype in murine models and discrepancies in its reported cellular expression (23). Specifically, both the Clrn1 KO and N48K knock-in mouse models of USH3A present with an early-onset hearing loss and are profoundly deaf by postnatal day P30 (7,24). However, both models lack a retinal degeneration phenotype (7,24). Our understanding of CLRN1 function primarily comes from cell-culture studies and research of the inner ear in mouse and zebrafish models (7,25\\u201327). Cell culture experiments have shown that CLRN1 is trafficked to the plasma membrane and may potentially function as a regulator of the actin organization (27). In mouse and zebrafish models of USH3A (clrn1), the mutant animals presented with disorganized stereocilia bundles, which are sensory organelles composed of actin-rich protrusions on the apical surface of the auditory and vestibular sensory hair cells (7,28\\u201331). Furthermore, the loss of clarin1 also led to the disorganization of the synaptic actin network in the inner hair cells in a mouse model of USH3 (31). By 7 days post fertilization (dpf), previously established USH3A zebrafish mutants presented with hearing deficits and splayed hair cells (28). These mutant animals did not survive into adulthood and there were no changes in retinal function in larvae as measured by electroretinogram (ERG) analysis (28). Within the inner ear, the disorganization of hair cell stereocilia prevented the proper transduction of mechanical force from sound, head movement, or gravity into electrical signals. These findings suggest that CLRN1 regulates the formation and maintenance of properly shaped hair bundles in both the outer and inner hair cells of the inner ear (26). Whether CLRN1 performs a similar role in maintaining the integrity of actin rich structures in the retina is unknown.\", \"Published studies indicate Clrn1 transcripts are abundantly enriched in M\\u00fcller glia, as compared to other cell types. In the early postnatal mouse retina, mRNA in-situ hybridization analysis revealed that Clrn1 expression was restricted to the INL and co-localized with M\\u00fcller glia cell-specific markers (7,32). In a cross-species study, in-situ-hybridization and single-cell RNAseq analysis revealed that Clrn1 transcripts in the mouse and human adult retina were concentrated to the INL and specifically enriched in M\\u00fcller glia (32). Other studies based on scRNAseq analysis have also reported that Clrn1 mRNA is enriched in retinal progenitors and M\\u00fcller glia across several species, including human, non-human primate, and zebrafish (33\\u201335). Transcriptomic studies suggest that several USH1 protein, including HARMONIN (USH1C), CDH23 (USH1D), and SANS (USH1G) are present in M\\u00fcller glia (33). Additionally, in vitro binding studies suggest that CLRN1 and HARMONIN may directly interact (31). Uncovering the roles of M\\u00fcller glia-expressed USH proteins in the retina will shed light not only on mechanisms of USH pathology, but also advance our understanding of the relationship between M\\u00fcller glia and photoreceptors.\", \"In this study, we developed an USH3A zebrafish model by deleting the clarin1 locus. Unlike the previously reported USH3A zebrafish models, homozygous mutants developed for this study are viable and survive into adulthood, enabling the identification of a photoreceptor degeneration phenotype and a detailed characterization of the importance of M\\u00fcller glia in USH3 ocular pathology.\"], \"3.2\": [\"To develop an USH3A model in zebrafish, 85% of the coding sequence for clrn1 was deleted through a CRISPR-Cas9 strategy. Specifically, we used one CRISPR gRNA that targeted a region of exon 1 and another CRISPR gRNA designed to target the 3\\u2019 UTR of clrn1 (Figure 1a). To confirm the deletion and establish a genotyping protocol, primers flanking the cut sites were designed to discriminate the genomic deletion (Supplemental Figure 1a). Additionally, Sanger sequencing (Supplemental Figure 1b) and RNAscope for clrn1 (Figure 1c) were applied to confirm the clrn1 deletion. Sanger sequencing demonstrated the elimination of the genomic region between the targeted CRISPR cut sites, while RNAscope analysis substantiated the complete loss of clrn1 transcripts (Supplemental Figure 1b, Figure 1c). Furthermore, RNAscope showed that in zebrafish, similar to other species, clrn1 transcripts concentrate in the inner nuclear layer of the retina. Lastly, to confirm the loss of Clrn1 function, we evaluated previously established hair cell phenotypes of the inner ear associated with USH3 models (7,28). At 7 dpf, the hair cell organization was grossly altered, with clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish larvae presenting with splayed stereocilia (Figure 1d). In some animals, pyknotic nuclei were also observed in the hair cells of the anterior macula at the time point investigated (Figure 1d). However, in clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 larvae no severe vestibular phenotype was observed, such as the circular swimming pattern reported in the myo7aa and pcdh15a mutant zebrafish, which model USH1B and USH1F, respectively (36\\u201338).\", \"Several established zebrafish models of USH do not survive into adulthood, including previously generated clrn1 mutant zebrafish, preventing the study of disease progression and pathophysiology (28). However, the clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish developed for this study do survive into adulthood, providing an opportunity to characterize aged retinal phenotypes. To assess whether mutant retinas show the progressive photoreceptor disorganization and degeneration that is observed in USH3A patients, we utilized optical coherence tomography (OCT), which can provide single cell resolution of photoreceptor cell organization. Retinas of wild-type and clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish were imaged at 4-, 8-, 12-, and 20-months post fertilization (mpf). From the OCT scans, en face images of the ultraviolet-sensitive (UV) cone photoreceptor packing arrangement and spacing regularity were assessed by Voronoi cell area, number of neighbors, and intercell distance regularity (39). Alterations in these measurements are an indication of disrupted photoreceptor structure and/or survival (39). As expected in wild-type zebrafish, a characteristic crystalline lattice of linear columns and rows of UV cone photoreceptors was observed (Figure 2a\\u2013d). At 4 and 8 mpf, clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish also displayed the highly regular photoreceptor arrangement, although at 8 mpf, there were a few discernable gaps in the mosaic (Figure 2e\\u2013f). By 12 mpf, the clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish exhibited more areas where signals generated by the photoreceptor outer segments were absent (Figure 2g\\u2013g\\u2019). At 20 mpf, an OCT reflective signal from cone outer segments was completely absent in 15% of the clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish (Figure 2h). Among the clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 retinas that still exhibited discrete reflective UV cone outer segments, the organization was significantly disrupted, as indicated by the loss of the hexagonal patterning in the Voronoi overlay (Figure 2h\\u2019\\u2019). In contrast, smaller changes, as part of normal ageing, occurred to the UV cone mosaic of wild-type animals from 4 to 20 mpf (Figure 2a\\u2013d). Collectively, the OCT data suggest age-dependent photoreceptor changes due to loss of Clrn1.\", \"To assess whether the loss of Clrn1 results in retinal dysfunction, we conducted ex vivo electroretinography (ERG) on retinas collected from 4- and 12- mpf wild-type or clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish. Our findings revealed discernible functional differences in both scotopic and photopic responses at these time points, as illustrated in Figure 3. Notably, we observed considerable variability in the scotopic b-wave among clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 fish, with 30% of the clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 fish displaying amplitudes greater than those observed in the 4 mpf wild-type zebrafish (Supplemental Figure 2a). Additionally, significant reductions in the photopic b-wave were observed in 4 mpf clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish (Figure 3b). Furthermore, substantial differences were noted in the amplitude of the flicker responses at lower frequencies (Figure 3c and Supplemental Figure 3). Collectively, these findings suggest functional disparities in visual transduction in 4 mpf clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 animals.\", \"Similar distinctions in scotopic and photopic responses were evident in the 12 mpf clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish when compared to their age-matched wild-type counterparts (Figure 3d\\u2013e). At 12 mpf, the scotopic b-waves were consistently diminished, and less variable (Figure 3d and Supplemental Figure 2c). Furthermore, the significant reduction in the photopic b-wave, coupled with a marked decrease in the photopic flicker response, persisted in the 12 mpf clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish (Figure 3d\\u2013f). At 12 mpf, an irregular patterning of the flicker response was also observed at 25 Hz and 30 Hz, suggesting potential deficits in the recovery of cone photoreceptor function between stimulations (Supplemental Figure 3a).\", \"In addition to amplitude, we evaluated differences in the scotopic and photopic b-wave implicit time. In 4 mpf fish, no significant difference in implicit times between mutants and wild-type siblings was observed (Supplemental Figure 4a and b). At 12 months of age, however, we did observe a significant increase in the photopic b-wave implicit time in clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish (Supplemental Figure 4d). Overall, our data suggests that the loss of Clrn1 affects both rod and cone functions.\", \"Differences in the clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish photoreceptor mosaic, as detected by OCT, may be attributed to cell death or disruption of the photoreceptor outer segments. Similarly, the differences in the ERG responses observed between clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish and their wild-type siblings could be due to the loss of photoreceptors or the presence of non-functional photoreceptors. Therefore, we performed histological analysis on retinal sections from 4-, 8-, 12-, and 20-mpf wild-type and clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish to determine if there was a loss of photoreceptor cells. At 20 mpf, we observed obvious thinning of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) in clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish (Figure 4a), compared to wild-type siblings. We therefore quantified the photoreceptor loss at early stages, and found a slow, but progressive thinning of the ONL starting as early as 4 mpf (Figure 4c). Analysis of rod versus cone loss reveals that the initial decrease in photoreceptor nuclei begins with rod degeneration, and the onset of cone degeneration began by 8 mpf (Figure 4e\\u2013f). In addition to the decrease in nuclei within the ONL, there was also a shortening of the rod outer segments, a phenotype frequently observed in models of retinal degeneration (40\\u201342) (Figure 4b and c).\", \"Unlike mammals, zebrafish can regenerate a damaged retina. Therefore, to assess potential cell regeneration we evaluated BrdU incorporation, which is often used to mark regeneration. We detected a small, but significant increase in BrdU-positive cells at 4 mpf (Supplemental Figure 5). At subsequent ages, BrdU incorporation remained moderately elevated (Supplemental Figure 5e and f), despite the overall loss of clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 photoreceptor cells with age. Given the loss of cells in the photoreceptor layer, the observed BrdU-positive cells may represent attempted but inadequate regeneration, and/or dying cells undergoing DNA repair; which has been reported (43\\u201348).\", \"Previous studies have shown that photoreceptor survival in mutant USH1 and USH2 larvae was compromised in a high-intensity light stress assay (16,17). To determine if similar sensitivities occurred in our USH3A zebrafish model, animals were exposed to constant and high-intensity light to enhance cell stress from 5\\u20137 dpf (Figure 5a). Under standard husbandry conditions, we did not observe histological changes or significant differences in cell death markers in either wild-type or clrn1 mutant larvae (Figure 5b, 2d\\u2013e). Similarly, in the wild-type fish exposed to constant and high-intensity light, we did not observe any histological changes or induction of cell death. Conversely, clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 fish exposed to constant and high-intensity light presented with significantly elevated number of pyknotic nuclei in the ONL layer (Figure 5b and 5d), indicating cell death. In addition to the presence of pyknotic nuclei, there was a significant increase in TUNEL-positive nuclei in the ONL, indicative of apoptosis (Figure 5b\\u2013c and 5e). We did not observe an increase in the abundance of pyknotic nuclei or TUNEL-positive cells in the other retinal layers of clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 fish.\", \"In addition to elevated cell death, we also evaluated potential functional changes following light damage. Using an optomotor response (OMR) assay, we tested larvae on their ability to detect direction changes. Unexpectedly, we observed functional deficits in the clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish housed under standard husbandry conditions compared to wild-type animals (Supplemental Figure 6). The failure of mutant larvae to respond to OMR stimulus under control lighting conditions suggests baseline visual impairment.\", \"As evident by ERG results, both rods and cones were affected by the loss of Clrn1. To discern if cell death in the ONL, following light damage, occurred in rods or cones, we stained with fluorescent wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA), which labels the rod and cone outer segments, respectively. In light-damaged clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish, there was a significant decrease in WGA and PNA-positive outer segments in the peripheral and central retina of clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish, compared to that of wild-type siblings (Figure 5f\\u2013j). Specifically, we noted a small, but significant decrease in the number of rod and cone outer segments in the peripheral retina of clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 7 dpf larvae in control lighting conditions, which was exacerbated with high-intensity light stress (Figure 5g\\u2013h). Collectively, data indicates that at the time point investigated, the rod and cone photoreceptors in clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish show signs of dysfunction and are sensitized to the cellular stress induced by elevated light exposure.\", \"Thus far, results highlight that the loss of Clrn1 in zebrafish induces a slow, progressive photoreceptor dysfunction and degeneration along with sensitization to light-mediated stress. Therefore, we focused on identifying retinal changes associated with the loss of Clrn1. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies suggest a possible role of CLRN1 in the regulation of the F-actin cytoskeleton (27,29\\u201331). To explore the function of Clrn1 in the retina, we first assessed the structure of the ribbon synapses and actin-rich structures of the photoreceptors in wild-type and clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish. In 7 dpf larvae, we did not find a substantial loss of synapses in the photoreceptor layer, as indicated by WGA staining, which stains pre- and post-synaptic membranes. (Supplemental Figure 7a and b). Ultra-structurally, there were no notable defects in the development of the rod (Supplemental Figure 7c and d) or cone (Supplemental Figure 7e and f) ribbon synapses. Similarly, in the adult retina, we observed comparable ribeye staining and appropriate localization of SV2 at the ribbon synapses, further indicating that the ribbon synapses are properly developed in the absence of Clrn1 (Supplemental Figure 7g\\u2013i). In summary, the photoreceptor synapses appeared normal in clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish.\", \"We next assessed for potential changes in actin structures of the outer retina. Following phalloidin staining, we observed altered actin organization in the photoreceptor layer of clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish compared to wild-type siblings (Figure 6b). In wild-type fish, actin staining ran perpendicular at the connecting cilium and parallel to the outer segments encompassing the photoreceptor in an actin-rich ring (Figure 6a). In clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish larvae, actin staining was disorganized along the outer segment and at the IS/OS junction (Figure 6b). While actin bundles running parallel to the outer segment were evident, the ring structure encompassing the outer segment appeared disorganized.\", \"On account of changes in actin staining and enriched clrn1 expression in M\\u00fcller glia (25,49), we explored in more detail M\\u00fcller glia structure in 7 dpf larvae. We used a transgenic M\\u00fcller glia reporter line, which expresses GFP downstream of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap) promoter (Tg(gfap:GFP). Comparing clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 and wild-type zebrafish, we did not observe obvious differences in M\\u00fcller glia numbers or structure at this age (Figure 8a). Specifically, we observed proper extension of M\\u00fcller glia processes in both wild-type and clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 fish from the INL to the photoreceptor layer, with cell bodies located in the second row of nuclei in the INL (50).\", \"While the abundance and gross morphology of M\\u00fcller glia were normal in clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 mutant zebrafish, the apical microvillar projections were reduced and disorganized. In wild-type larvae, the M\\u00fcller glia apical microvilli extended beyond the outer limiting membrane (OLM), projecting in a parallel fashion along the photoreceptor outer segments (Figure 6c). These structures were also observed in clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish but were reduced in number (Fig 6c\\u2013d). They also appeared more variable in length, and were less linear in appearance, reminiscent of the splayed stereocilia phenotype of inner ear hair cells (Figure 1d, 6c\\u2013d, and 7b).\", \"A common phenotype of several USH1 zebrafish mutants is disrupted photoreceptor calyceal processes (15,51). To investigate the cone calyceal processes of clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 mutants in more detail, we developed a transgenic line, Tg(gnat2:Lifeact-mCherry), that expresses Lifeact, an F-actin binding protein (52), under the cone-specific gnat2 promoter. Transverse cryosections showed enriched staining of Lifeact-mCherry within the calyceal processes, as well as at the adherens-type junctions of the OLM (Fig 7a). Calyceal processes of clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 mutants were disorganized and showed a spectrum of phenotypes. The majority of mutant retinas showed elongated, moderately splayed calyceal processes that were reduced in number compared to those of wild-type siblings (Fig 7b). Others were more severely splayed and contained Lifeact-mCherry puncta (Fig 7c). Lifeact-mCherry puncta were also noted at the OLM (Figure 7c\\u2019\\u2019 and g\\u2019\\u2019). Given the similarity of phenotypes between mutant M\\u00fcller glia apical microvilli and the photoreceptor calyceal processes, we combined the gnat2:Lifeact-mCherry and gfap:GFP transgenes to investigate potential associations between these actin-rich structures. We found that in wild-type retina the apical projections of M\\u00fcller glia were in close association with cone calyceal processes (Fig 7a merged). However, this association was often disrupted in clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 retina (Fig7 b,c merged).\", \"En face analysis of Tg(gfap:gfp) and Tg(gnat2:lifeact_mCherry) further highlighted the association of the M\\u00fcller glia apical projections with calyceal processes of cones, which present as mCherry-positive rings with embedded puncta, highlighting cortical actin and the bundled actin of the calyceal actin. Figure 7d\\u2013d\\u2019\\u2019 shows this structure for the UV cone photoreceptors. In close proximity to each actin ring, we found GFP puncta, which corresponds to the M\\u00fcller glia apical microvilli. Within each actin ring, there are on average 5\\u20136 associated M\\u00fcller glia projections. In clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish, we observed regions of disrupted actin ring formation (Figure 7e\\u2019\\u2019). The M\\u00fcller glia apical projections are also more irregular in their shape and pattern and have reduced association with the cone actin structures.\", \"En face analysis in clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish also confirmed altered cone photoreceptor actin and M\\u00fcller glia association at the level of the OLM. Specifically, we observed regions of actin accumulation, which was not evident in wild-type animals. Analysis of the M\\u00fcller glia morphology also showed changes in the projections that envelop the photoreceptors at the OLM (Fig 7g, f). These data suggest alteration to the adherens-type junctions of the OLM. Because of these changes, we immunostained for N-cadherin, a component of the OLM junctions. In a previous in vitro study using overexpressed HA-tagged CLRN1, pull-down assays with an anti-HA antibody followed by proteomic analysis identified N-cadherin as one potential CLRN1 binding partner (27). In wild-type animals, as anticipated, we observed an even distribution of N-cadherin staining along the junctions of the OLM (Figure 8a and a\\u2019). In clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish, N-cadherin staining appeared less evenly distributed along the junctions (Figure 8b\\u2019). Additionally, we observed a decrease in the localization of N-cadherin at the OLM (Figure 8b\\u2019 and d). Outside of the OLM, N-cadherin staining was occasionally mis-localized in a radial pattern extending basally within the mutant retina. (Figure 8b\\u2019). Ultra-structural analysis of the OLM junctions revealed that the loss of N-cadherin staining was not due to the failure of junction formation in the absence of Clrn1 (Supplemental Figure 10). Analysis of actin staining, M\\u00fcller glia morphology, and N-cadherin staining at the OLM does suggest differences in the structural integrity of the OLM. Notably, the OLM highlighted by N-cadherin staining appeared expanded and disorganized. This phenotype is likely due to clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 mutants being sensitized to the methanol treatment performed with N-cadherin staining (Figure 8b\\u2019), as histology and other marker analyses which do not require methanol treatment did not show this degree of OLM expansion. Quantitation of N-cadherin ring diameter did not highlight any statistically significant differences (p=0.15), but we did observe a shift in the diameter of the N-cadherin rings at the OLM towards a larger size (Figure 8b and e).\", \"Because of prominent Clrn1 expression in M\\u00fcller glia, we explored whether re-expression of Clrn1 only within M\\u00fcller glia could rescue the retinal defects caused by its global loss. Specifically, we developed two Tg(gfap:clrn1-2a-GFP) lines. The 2a peptide sequence allows for the co-transcription of clrn1 and GFP (Supplemental Figure 8a), facilitating the identification of transgenic zebrafish and cells expressing Clrn1 without hindering Clrn1 function by the addition of an N- or C-terminus epitope (53). Additionally, because clrn1 and GFP are co-transcribed, the measure of GFP fluorescence intensity allows for relative quantification of transgene expression and, therefore, an indirect estimate of clrn1 re-expression levels. During the development of the F1 generation, two lines, designated as high re-expression (gfap:Clrn1high) and low re-expression (gfap:Clrn1low) were identified that differed significantly in their level of GFP expression (Supplemental Figure 8b\\u2013d). Differences in the expression levels between the gfap:Clrn1low and gfap:CLRNhigh were quantified on the F2 generation by measuring the total GFP fluorescence intensity (Supplemental Figure 8c). The number of GFP-positive offspring from the F2 generation was also tracked to confirm germline transmission of a single copy for each line.\", \"Using the M\\u00fcller glia specific Clrn1 re-expression lines, we assessed M\\u00fcller glia structure in wild-type and clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish expressing the gfap:Clrn11high or gfap:Clrn1low. For assessing M\\u00fcller glia structure on the gfap:Clrn11low transgenic lines, gfap:Clrn1low zebrafish were raised on a Tg(gfap:GFP) background because the GFP signal from the gfap:Clrn1low transgene was significantly quenched during the process of fixation to levels beyond detection by confocal microscopy (Supplemental Figure 8d). In this instance, a PCR designed towards the gfap:Clrn1_2a_GFP sequence was performed to identify zebrafish harboring the gfap:CLRN1low transgene.\", \"Analysis of M\\u00fcller glia structure in the gfap:Clrn1high transgenic zebrafish, in either wild-type or clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 mutants, revealed gross alterations in the structure of M\\u00fcller glia and photoreceptor cells. Specifically, M\\u00fcller glial process associated with photoreceptor synapses and the OLM were disorganized (Supplemental Figure 9d). In addition, the apical microvilli were reduced \\u2013 even beyond that of clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 mutants alone. Within photoreceptors, actin staining (phalloidin) within the region of the outer segments appeared enhanced and disorganized, likely reflecting the overall structural disruption of photoreceptor outer segments (Supplemental Figure 7d). In clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish expressing the gfap:Clrn1low transgene, the M\\u00fcller glia synaptic and OLM projections, as well as the apical microvilli, showed wild-type morphology (Supplemental Figure 9c). Similarly, within photoreceptors, defects in phalloidin staining were partially rescued. We also observed an increase in the localization of N-cadherin along the junctions of the OLM and an improvement in the distribution of N-cadherin along these junctions within clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 Tg(gfap:Clrn1low) zebrafish and partial correction in the N-cadherin ring structure (Figure 8). This analysis overall indicates the importance of appropriate levels of Clrn1 within M\\u00fcller glia for the structural integrity of the outer retina.\", \"To determine whether targeted re-expression of clrn1 in the M\\u00fcller glia could serve as a therapeutic option for preventing or slowing retinal degeneration in USH3A, we subjected the gfap:Clrn1 transgenic zebrafish to high-intensity light treatment, which was previously established to induce cell death in clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish (Figure 5). For this experiment, we treated wild-type and clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish carrying either a gfap:GFP control transgene or one of the Clrn1 re-expression transgenes. As before, larvae were exposed to either standard or high-intensity light from 5 to 7 dpf. Several important observations were made from these studies. First, low Clrn1 re-expression within M\\u00fcller glia of clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 mutants rescued photoreceptor cell death from light stress, as measured by pyknotic nuclei or TUNEL labeling. Low Clrn1 expression in wild-type did not affect wild-type retina. However, high Clrn1 re-expression within M\\u00fcller glia was damaging to photoreceptors in either normal or light stressed conditions, and in either wild-type or clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 mutants (Figure 9). These results both highlight the potential for gene therapy and emphasize the importance of Clrn1 dosage.\", \"Due to conflicting reports on whether Clrn1 is expressed in the photoreceptor layer (7,25,32\\u201335), we undertook a similar approach to re-express Clrn1 in the rod and cone photoreceptors. We established lines for rod-specific (Tg(rho:clrn1_2a_mCherry)) and cone-specific (Tg(gnat2:clrn1_2a_mCherry)) Clrn1 expression. We also established the respective control lines, Tg(rho:mCherry), Tg(gnat2:GFP). In contrast to M\\u00fcller glia re-expression of Clrn1, the rod or cone photoreceptors expressing Clrn1 in a clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 mutant background were not protected against light stress (Figure 10).\"], \"3.3\": [\"In the current study, we developed a model of USH3A in zebrafish using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to delete the coding sequence of clrn1. This represents the first animal model of USH3 that displays retinal degeneration, allowing us to investigate the impact of Clrn1 absence on the retina and the cells that contribute to progressive vision loss. Our results show that USH3A zebrafish retinas are sensitized to high-intensity light, and the cell death observed in the photoreceptor layer was due to loss of both rods and cones. In aging animals, we observed retinal dysfunction at the earliest time point investigated (4 mpf). In larval fish, differential therapeutic potentials were observed following the re-expression of Clrn1 in M\\u00fcller glia. Low re-expression of Clrn1 in M\\u00fcller glia was associated with a reduction in photoreceptor apoptosis, underscoring the involvement of M\\u00fcller glia in the pathophysiology of USH3A. Conversely, with high Clrn1 expression, the therapeutic advantages were negated. Critically, this heightened expression of Clrn1 in M\\u00fcller glia induced the loss of photoreceptors in wild-type larvae and exacerbated the light stress induced photoreceptor cell death in clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 animals. This data provides important baseline knowledge to guide potential gene therapy initiatives.\", \"Unlike previously described clrn1 mutant zebrafish, the clrn1 mutants developed for this study survived into adulthood. Survival differences may be due to the genetic background or husbandry practices, as well as type of mutation. For our allele, we deleted 85% of the coding sequence, resulting in decay of the transcribed mRNA. For the previous USH3A zebrafish model, zinc finger nucleases were used to produce smaller deletions ranging from 7 bp to 43 bp within the first exon of the coding sequence (28). While these mutations lead to the introduction of a premature stop codon, there are potential downstream start sites in subsequent exons, allowing for the potential expression of truncated proteins. Stop codon read-through is also possible. The expression of an altered Clrn1 protein could lead to the activation of stress responses not observed in our clrn1 knockout zebrafish line. On that note, in humans, one predominant mutation CLRN1N48K leads to loss of protein glycosylation and improper trafficking of CLRN1 (22,26,27). While we did not observe markers of ER stress in mutant animals (Supplemental Figure 11), the loss of glycosylation and protein trafficking for CLRN1N48K could activate the UPR response, as was previously reported for USH1 proteins in hair cells (54). In support of this idea, genotype-to-phenotype analysis in USH1B patients reports that disease progression is less severe in populations carrying null MYO7A alleles (55).\", \"Consistent with previous reports on clrn1 mutant zebrafish lines, in the absence of additional stressors, we did not observe any gross histological changes to the structure and lamination of the retina at 7dpf. As others have done, we used high-intensity light treatment to enhance cellular stress on retinal cell types (15\\u201317,56,57). Following light stress, cell death was significantly increased in clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish, as detected by pyknotic nuclei and TUNEL staining, which were elevated in both rods and cones. Within the peripheral and central retina, we observed a significant reduction in the number of rods and cones in clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish. While this is the first report of clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish presenting with a sensitivity to light damage, these findings are in accordance with other zebrafish models of USH (15\\u201317), as well as other retinitis pigmentosa zebrafish models that also presented with increased cell death following treatment with a high-intensity light (58,59).\", \"In non-stressed conditions, we observed progressive functional and structural changes in the retina of clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish, compared to their age-matched wild-type siblings. At 4 mpf, ERGs revealed rod and cone dysfunction. Interestingly, we did not observe a statistical difference in the average scotopic b-wave, but we did find greater variability in the scotopic B-wave of clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish. Specifically, 30% of the animals presented with a hyper-response. At this same age, we observed an increase in BrdU-positive cells, which predominantly occurred in the region of the retina where the rod nuclei reside. Newly regenerated photoreceptors may affect the B-wave due to their immaturity or may promote circuit re-wiring as they integrate into the existing retina. At 4 mpf, we also observed a significant decrease in the photopic B-wave, implicating cone dysfunction. The decrease in the photopic ERG response could be due to the degeneration of cones or impaired cone function. Alternatively, M\\u00fcller glia defects may affect opsin recycling, and account for differences in the scotopic and photopic responses. In mice, scotopic b-wave enhancements were observed during light-adapted ERGs early in the degenerative process of Rd10 (PDE6 mutant) mice (60). In patients with cone dystrophy with supernormal rod response, patients present with elevated rod b-wave responses at higher light intensities, which is in agreement with the observations of hyper-responding clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish (61,62). However, the ERG presentation in clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 zebrafish deviates from the ERG recordings described for USH3A patients. In patients with USH3A, early ERG dysfunction begins with a reduced scotopic response and progresses to reduced photopic response, as is typical of rod-cone dysfunction. The species differences in progression of ERG defects may be due to several reasons. These include (A) the more heterogenous rod-to-cone composition across the human retina compared to the consistent ratios in zebrafish, (B) potential activation of regeneration in zebrafish, or (C) differential roles of M\\u00fcller glia in retinoid recycling.\", \"Towards identifying a potential retinal function of clrn1 and the pathological factors promoting retinal degeneration in USH3A, we focused on characterizing alterations in the actin-based structures in the outer retina. We found that the loss of Clrn1 leads to changes in the M\\u00fcller glia apical microvilli and contacts between photoreceptors. The apical microvilli projections appear more disorganized, with variable lengths, similar to reported stereocilia phenotypes of the inner ear of clrn1 mutants (63). These results are consistent with the function of Clrn1 in actin organization and dynamics. In wild-type fish, the M\\u00fcller glia projections appeared to envelop the base of the photoreceptor outer segments, suggesting structural support. Similar findings have also been recently highlighted by Sharkova et al (10). We further described a close association between the M\\u00fcller glia apical microvilli and cone calyceal processes, a discovery facilitated through our development and application of the cone-specific Lifeact transgenic line (Figure 7). Our analysis of clrn1\\u2212/\\u2212 mutants suggests that the association between M\\u00fcller glia apical microvilli and photoreceptor calyceal processes is mediated by Clrn1 (Figure 11). We anticipate this may be through direct or indirect interaction between Muller glia expressed Clrn1 and photoreceptor expressed USH-associated proteins. In accordance with this hypothesis, the enhanced cell death we observed following high-intensity light stress may result from the reduced structural integrity. Additionally, alterations at the clrn1 mutant OLM, including N-cadherin distribution are consistent with another role of M\\u00fcller glia-derived Clrn1 in mediating the integrity of the adherents-type junctions and thus providing additional structural support to photoreceptor (Figure 11). Clrn1 function at the OLM may in part be mediated through interactions with N-cadherin, and M\\u00fcller glia expressed USH-associated proteins, such as Harmonin. In accordance with this, defects observed in our gfap:Clrn1high transgenic animals; may in part be a consequence of perturbing secondary functions of Clrn1 interactors; such as Harmonin an essential protein in photoreceptor synaptic development (14). Accordingly, further work identifying Clrn1 interactors will be essential in conferring changes directly induced by the loss of Clrn1 function versus those occurring as a secondary consequence.\", \"Overall, our results suggest that Clrn1 within M\\u00fcller glia has roles in regulating the structure of M\\u00fcller glia and non-autonomously maintaining photoreceptor homeostasis. Future studies aimed at the identification of Clrn1-binding partners within M\\u00fcller glia could assist in better defining precise cellular mechanisms. Importantly, these findings suggest gene replacement therapy for USH3A patients holds promise, but the dosage and timing of CLRN1 expression within M\\u00fcller glia must be carefully evaluated.\"], \"3.4\": [\"All transgenic and mutant lines were generated and maintained in the ZDR genetic background.
